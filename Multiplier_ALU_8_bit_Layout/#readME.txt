8 Bit Multiplier and ALU Physical Layout Design

In this project, an 8 bit multiplier and 8 bit ALU physical layout is designed by using Electric VLSI.
In the 8 bit multiplier part, vedic multiplier architecture is used since it is faster and simpler than other architectures. Size of the multiplier is reduced as much as possiblle to have a better performance, and the designed multiplier's pin connections are made with a 1.5mm X 1.5mm bare pad frame.

In the 8 bit ALU part, an ALU capable of doing multiplication, addition, subtruction, 1 bit left and right shifting, 2 bit right shifting, buffering and inversion operations is designed.

NOTE: The "ServetCelik_ELE419_Project.jelib" library should be opened with "MOSSIS_SUBM_PADS_C5.jelib" library since the pad cell "Analog_barepadframe_1.5mmX1.5mm" is copied from that library.
